 Algorithm library

 Hi, everyone.
 I am going to store every algorithms that I learnt, I found, I realised and I enjoyed to here!

 Feel free to give some comments on it!
 Thanks!

 Naming Convention (applied on variable and function)
 int			= n
 char			= c
 string			= sz
 CString		= str
 struct			= st
 long			= l
 unordered set	= us;

 Depth First Search
 Time Complexity	= O(Vectices + Edge) = O(V+N)
 Space Complexity	= O(V) //How many level of vertices
 Application		= Use to find the edge/node which is far away
